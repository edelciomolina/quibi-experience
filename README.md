# Quibi Experience

Just for the pleasure of coding and creating things, this project was born from the perspective of the recreating Quibi's Video Player environment using only web technologies.

But before continuing, you need to know about the Quibi's proposal!

In summary, technically what calls our attention is the possibility of watching a movie or series and according to the orientation of your mobile the perspectives of vision and even history will changes, see this preview:

## The challenge
The first Commit of this Repository was born from the principle that we have one or two players running in parallel, where each one has its individual video where these have the same duration and are synchronized. *(This may not be the ideal path, but we will find out throughout this project)*

As a challenge, we will follow by 5 main premises:
- [ ] You should only use HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT (Back or Front)
- [ ] Enable the user to select 2 distinct videos (Vertical and Horizontal)
- [ ] Enable the user to define whether the main audio will be, from one or both videos
- [ ] The player must have Play, Pause, Forward, Rewind and Stop mechanisms
- [ ] When rotating the mobile the player must switch between one video and another without this interfering with the user experience
